Description: fast, scalable, distributed revision control system (obsolete)
 Git is popular version control system designed to handle very large
 projects with speed and efficiency; it is used for many high profile
 open source projects, most notably the Linux kernel.
 .
 Git falls in the category of distributed source code management tools.
 Every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with full
 revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a
 central server.
 .
 This is a transitional dummy package.  The 'git-core' package has been
 renamed to 'git', which has been installed automatically.  This
 git-core package is now obsolete, and can safely be removed from the
 system if no other package depends on it.
